First diary entry. Tbh I’m Lowkey just doing this cause I feel like there’s no one I can be truly honest with, and it’s been a while since I’ve just let go. Today was the last day at accommodation, and the last day of the first year of imperial. It’s 6 am and I’ve been chilling in the b204 kitchen with the people from the floor above for the whole night - weirdly similar to how we did the exact same thing on the first day of accommodation... weird full circle...I feel a bit weird right now, I met some cool people I fuck with but I do kinda feel like I could have made better use of my time here, especially girl wise. I went to multiple rave kitchen parties today (covid lol) and saw a really cute girl talking to a Portuguese girl I fw from the floor below but I didn’t even say a word to her... pissed because that kinda sums up my biggest struggle right now. I know what I want and know what to do but something inside me is holding me back, almost as if it doesn’t want me to fuck or get in a relationship with a girl... I really wanted to lose this pussy behavior by going to camp in the US, and I should have been there since last week if it wasn’t for this shit travel ban. I’m sad because I feel like right now I’m being complacent with my girl situation. No one knows this but I haven’t made out with a girl since March 2020. The worst part is that I’ve had sooo many chances but I just fumble it over and over and over again. Being in the US surrounded by people my age that would be fucking like rabbits and doing activities that build self confidence every day was my perfect solution to the problem but now that it’s not happening I’m scared I’m going to continue being a virgin that almost purposely fumbles every opportunity for the rest of my life. I had the opportunity with Esha, who’s not really hot or my type at all, but I did feel a bit attracted to but it’s just that I have mixed feelings about this shit when it gets to the moment. Not even to mention the time with Mencia when I fucking slept over in her room and didn’t even make out - even she said herself I was the first guy that slept over and didn’t fuck.
I thought the whole point of game was to make sure I wouldn’t get these shitty experiences anymore but all it has done is make me super cocky and peacocking with my blonde hair, gold chain, rings and shit. Tbh I know that it works to get girls attracted, I can feel them being attracted to me - or atleast seeing potential for them to become attracted - but then I just don’t know how to progress.
I want to learn the routines and all that shit to make sure I’m able to figure out how to handle those situations, but I feel like until I’m able to approach a random ass girl with confidence without having to be drunk it’s gonna be fucking useless to learn these techniques, especially if I never get to apply them.
So overall, I don’t fucking know what to do with my life at this point. I’m taking a shit right now while writing this and I still have to pack my bags for my fight back to Portugal in a couple of hours. I don’t like my course (tbh I do think I passed tho), my girl situation here is total shit imo, and although i met loads of people, I only really found a very very few set of people that I’m able to vibe with... of those which I met like a month ago.
Right now I’m hoping summer is going to be good, despite not feeling super confident about it. I really want to fuck someone, I feel like that is the main thing that’s holding me back from approaching other girls - the thought that I’m just a fraud. Someone with lots of experience yet no experience. And I feel like until I’m able to actually fuck and walk the talk, I won’t be able to grow as a person.
So that’s where I’m at right now. Kinda fucked but i know I could be dealing with much worse things right now. I hope that I continue writing these entries, that feel like I’m getting shjt off my chest and thinking about it.
I want to write so much more now that I’ve started but hopefully I’ll continue writing regularly from now on.

I don’t know how to start these shits. Today was an alright day, we went to have lunch near Torres vedras and I DJd for a bit outside. To be honest now that I’m saying it out loud it was kinda boring. What’s been going through my mind a lot lately is the fact that I don’t have any close friends right now, other than Omar and Mohamed. And I don’t mean best friends, I just mean people I can randomly call and there wouldn’t have to be a reason for calling. I want to travel to bratislava but I’m afraid it’s going to be boring and I won’t have friends to go out with. To be honest I can stay with the barbiers like usual and maybe we can do some shit, and since this is me speaking to myself I can be honest, maybe I’ll have a chance with Elise to do something. But I’m kinda frustrated in a way because I don’t know who to hit up, I feel like I’m not close with anybody really. Honesty I think I’m just over reacting and I should just stop giving a shit and just go. Get a car and worst case I’ll go visit prague and other places.
I haven’t gone out with friends in a couple of days and it’s starting to fuck with me. The worst part is that I don’t have concrete plans for the upcoming future. I’ll hit up Bernardo in the morning and arranje something.
Other than that, I’ve almost finished my DJ CV and I think tomorrow I’m going to start sending it out to a bunch of different applications around Europe. I want to explore new shit and be spontaneous. To be honest I’ve been thinking more and more about dropping out of university. I find the shit I study so boring and the university is so unlike me... I don’t even know. My parents would be pissed I can just tell and they’d think I’d just be throwing my life away. That’s why I think that if I have a solid plan they’ll be more likely to understand

So it’s been quite a while since I last wrote anything here. I don’t really know why I don’t write more. Currently im on the plane back from Bratislava where I just spent the weekend. I had lots of fun there - 4 days is the perfect length. I was barely ever alone the whole time. On the first day we had a barbecue at victors place, we invited like 12 people and it was really amazing to talk with the people that I used to see everyday. I love this tradition. On the second day we went clubbing in trafo. I got super fucking wasted and pissed in the fountain. The only regret that night was that I didn’t talk enough to girls. There was ester and Mia that I could have done sooo much more. What pisses me off is that I spent so much time reading those PUA books so that I would know exactly what to do in those situations. This is the same thing that happened last night when I was with Linda K going on a roadtrip. I knew that I could get her if I did the right things / routines. But I just didn’t know what to do in the moment, so we just ended up talking, we barely had any Kino. I need to have better game plans to fall back on in situations like that. Because I really didn’t know where I was heading with the situation. Either ways, I do honestly feel like a bit of a jacksaw cause I was with sima out in a date during the day and with her sister at night. And obviously I know this won’t go on for very long if I try to keep balancing the two sisters like this, and I’m going to end up having both girls hating me... so maybe it was a good thing that nothing happened between me and Linda, despite at the moment me being completely disappointed about it.
I also had edibles on Saturday with viktor and Alem. First of all, fuck that red velvet cake edible we made in London. It basically fucked me up for all future edibles. I literally couldn’t eat the brownies without gagging, my body just became so sick of the smell of cooked weed in cake I felt repulsed.
Either ways I forced myself to eat it and we got soooo high. It was a really good high. I laughed so much, we talked, and I never felt paranoid or sad or depressed. I remember us just blankly staring at the DVD menu page for half an hour cause we couldn’t get netflix to work.
Overall, the trip was fun. It is just so frustrating I didn’t kiss anyone. The longer this drought lasts the more self conscious I get about it. But the problem is that I’m also not making effort to change anything. It’s like I’m in standby waiting for someone else to make the move...

It’s been a really long time since I’ve written anything and for some reason I feel like I want to do one of these. This weekend and in general everything that happened since last time I wrote one of these diaries has been so crazy. Without holding anything back I know I’m gonna sound so corny but it is what it is. I finally fucked, honestly I think I’m better than I expected to be, first Laura and second Andrea, I’m a bit relieved I guess but since happening it’s not a big deal, I don’t hold any pressure under sex anymore and I think this is what I wanted to feel the whole time. I honestly feel like I’ve been happier person since last time I wrote this. Somehow I’ve been able to balance a party lifestyle while still being able to pass my courses. I’ve accepted that I don’t like my course but I’ll finish this shit. Next year I think will be easier and more tailored towards me and so that keeps me a bit motivated. Now there’s so much shit to say I don’t have the time or patience to write it all so I’ll jump to this weekend.
For the second time I did ecstasy. I bought it for the first time as well which was a bit of a step forward but I bought all the purity tests to make sure I got something good, I think that was the smartest thing I did because the whole time I was buzzing I knew in the back of my mind the thing I took was pure and everything would be great.
I took it with Pepe and Lucka and went to fabric. Crazy shit. We took it in the line and by the time we got through all the queues me and lucka somewhat split from the rest of our group and I’m not joking those 30 minutes (I think that was how long) me and her were wandering around and dancing and meeting people were the best 30 minutes of my life. I couldn’t stop smiling. Me and her were holding each other by our sides and just vibing like crazy. There wasn’t that much sexual desire for her on my part which I was surprised but also happy because I could just focus on enjoying the night. I was so happy some guy stopped me while we were walking in the crowd and said “you look so gassed, I fucking love it”
That shit is amazing
The rest of the night was good, but obviously as time went on and the effects started to fade it got a bit more boring, all the dopamine was depleted and shit. It hit lucka the worst, she just got bored and looked a little out of it. It’s a shame because it kinda killed my vibe as well. That’s why next time we have to have a bigger group of people doing it because it’s that energy that keeps the effect going.
Nonetheless, I felt a bit of morning depression. Don’t think it was anything special just felt like last night was so amazing that The morning just felt a bit shit, but I guess that’s the price you pay.
I think it’s a great drug if you do it in the right place with the right people, I’m gonna limit myself to only doing it once every 2 months because if you start getting used to feeling that good I feel like it’s gonna be a very dangerous rabbit hole. Need to try that shit with Pedro and his friends, since they’re so much more experienced I can just imagine it must be so good. I’m guessing with a big enough group we could turn it into a tradition every X months we go to ministry on E, and then come back to our place and everyone crashes there. That was the biggest thing that didn’t happen yesterday. Lucka initially was meant to stay at ours but as she became more bored and less euphoric she decided to go home, I don’t think it was good on her part but at the same time I have to respect it. But I remember doing it with Lucas and the thing I loved the most was the walk home from ministry with all the other like 6 people that we went with and we all just went back to Lucas’s house and smoked a j as the sun came up. I think that’s the best way to end the night, big group, walk home (not taxi) and a J while sitting outside.
I wanna do it again soon, but with new people as well. I got worried for a bit because Pepe loved it so much he kept on saying we have to do this next week and shit and I was like fuuuuck this guy might get addicted. Since I have the dealer only I guess I get to kind of make sure he doesn’t fall down that path.
I really wanna try it with Juli, that shit must be crazy there as well. I really vibed with her when I went to Paris. I had a bit of an agenda to sleep with her which I guess fucked me up but I think she also Lowkey wanted it but the conditions just weren’t right. I wanna go paris again to meet her friends and have some fun there I feel like I would love it. I don’t know if I could be able to smash I feel like my brain is now fucked up with her but I guess I could pop a viagra and that will fix the psychological issues. But more than that I miss having a girl I emotionally connect with. I thought it would be Linda but shit didn’t go according to plan so that’s a suspended story for now. Juli is also a girl I couldnt see myself with for a long time, even if we lived in the same city. I would much rather her being a friend with benefits that we could go on trips together and have so much fun, but the commitment I think always fucks it.
I wanna have a girlfriend for the first time in a long time. Now that I’ve done hookups I see that there’s a bit of emptiness when you guys leave. I haven’t cuddled in so long that’s the shit I miss. The comfort of being with someone beautiful and fun next to you while u guys just speak about life. Thing is I don’t know how to find someone like that. Within my close circle I don’t meet new people very often. Being with the Slovaks kinda limits you
to the same people all the time which is dead. That’s why next year I wanna live with Lucas and kings people. Need to meet new people. I don’t wanna bitch here because I’m in a pretty good mood but I just think it’s not healthy the habits the other guys here have, and just by living with them it dissipates to me. So I have to leave. It’s a bit tough because I know that it will change the dynamics for next year but I need to be a bit selfish here for my sake. These guys have no ambition or motivation and I’m the opposite of that. It will also mean I might have to pay more next year, but honesty I don’t care too much my income is pretty steady, I have at the moment around 3k pounds in emergency funds plus like 3k in spending accounts and more in crypto stocks and debt from Pepe. I feel financially secure but I realized I need to relax on my spending. Emergency funds really helped me with that, if I move 80% of my money there and I see my balance at 500 I know I can’t exceed that. I spent around 100 this weekend which is chill cause I made around 200 from tutoring so it works out but I don’t have the mentality of breaking even I want to accumulate money so I can start pursuing my passions and investing in shit. I feel like I know I’m gonna be successful. This summer in the US will really help me with the social aspect. I feel a bit more shy than I once was and my game is complete shit. Even though people think I have good game I think it’s very average. Being in the us and having to be the goofy funny one for 2-3 months I think will re-wire my brain and will give me so many new skills I will use in so many areas. I’m super excited for that.
Anyways, I’ve been writing a shit ton, I haven’t mention a bunch of things, like going into depth about Linda but that’s just cause I don’t feel like thinking about her. I know she probably has a guy now so it’s gonna be pathetic asf on my side If I’m romanticizing about a girl that doesn’t even think of me. My goal is to be so successful and such a fun and interesting she’s going to want to be with me but I won’t want to be with her. That’s why I really do think the most important thing is to work on myself. I need to be someone I admire. Someone people are envious of. Someone who people are attracted to because their life is so fun and they’re such a good presence around them that it feels amazing to be with them. And to do that I need to put in the work. I need to send shit to clubs if I really wanna get my break with DJing, I need to work on my efficiency to do everything. I think that to do that I need to be surrounded by people that also want to be like that. Ideally I’d wanna live with Linda B and kings friends. Perfect balance of productivity and fun. But that’s not realistic so we go for the next best thing. Either ways that’s that. Shits looking good, I like where my life is heading. I just gotta make sure I take the right route.
Oh and PS Silvia and her new bf were also here this weekend and at fabric. Felt like shit is chill between me and her now, I don’t care too much about what happened in the past and I was happy I got to vibe with some new faces

On the plane right now coming from dubai. I fucked up when buying the flights and I bought the flights from Vienna to Paris for Juli for March instead of fucking February... had to spend another 190 on her. I get bursts of frustration for that, mainly at my self because it was 100% my fault, but also at the fact that I don’t want to be paying for her. I kinda got what I wanted from her, as much of a dick as that sounds. I know it’s my commitment to get her back obviously but idk I litteraly see it as money in the trash because I’m not getting anything by paying her that.
I guess now that we’re coming back and I kind of tested this pilot program of bringing girls with me on a trip I can conclude a couple of things.
The main thing is that it works and I think I’m going to start doing it, even though the flights are annoying, if I look at it in the greater sense, it’s all I’m really paying FOR them. The rest is experiences that enhance it for me as well. I don’t mind it too much. However, just as with Omar and with Julie, 7-8 days is too much to have them all day besides you. I think 4-5 days is perfect. After that I get tired and bored of them. With Omar it was chill cause he’s a guy and naturally funny so I could just not give a fuck and shit, but with Julie especially today I was so sick of her. It started in the night we went out yesterday with Silvia and Emmett in dubai, which was amazing I’m so happy to see them and I really look forward to coming back to dubai so I can hang out with them. But Julie just didn’t quite fit in in the club, she’s just not the same type of person as my friends. Idk she had a bit of BO, wearing flip flops (not necessary her fault and she was embarrassed by it as well) but in general she didn’t look nice. And i think it kind of embarrassed me by association. I was having so much fun with them and Julie just wasn’t fully fitting in and was like let’s go dance but I didn’t want to be alone with her when I could be with these friends that I was so much happier with. But I couldn’t be a dick. It pissed me off. I would have stayed longer with them in the club, done more fun stuff and overall would have had a better time. And I think from that period I really became sick of her. We were drunk as fuck on coming back and went to Wendy’s before the hotel to get some food. Then I really just wanted to pass out but she wanted to fuck. I didn’t want to, deep down I was annoyed at her and dont find her physically attractive and having seen Silvia there I really just wanted to fuck her instead. I think I realized then that there’s nothing wrong with wanting a girl that is physically atttraxtive to my standards. But either ways she got me to fuck and it was fine but idk the whole time I just tried not to focus on the fact it was her and much more just trying to feel good. Albeit the experience with Julie was bittersweet in the sense that i wish I would have invited a hotter girl, I do think I learned some incredibly important things. I stopped being so insecure about sex and my body infront of women. I stopped giving a shit and pressuring myself, I stopped being worried about not getting hard. Now I’m just worried cause I cum way too quick and it’s embarrassing. My round 2 game is way better I need to jerk off before fucking cause it’s hella bad I last like 5-10 min
I also regained a lot of my abilities that I used to have with being friends with girls and how to chill with them that I think turkey fucked me with. Most importantly though, which I don’t think I’ve fully learned but I realized with her how important it is just to simply ASK for what you want. You want to fuck
her? Literally say it. It’s so difficult at first but since they like me and are attracted that’s all it takes. I think I underestimate how much power there is in simply asking for what I want, especially when it comes to girls.
I’m happy with the way things turned out, I’m pissed about the amount of money I fucking spent on deposits for cars that I’m going to have to stress over for the next month to make sure I get them Back, and the fucking flight that I just wasted on this girl I have no desire in fucking.
I’m really excited for tomorrow and being back in london I really miss the guys in the flat and I’m so hyped for tomorrow night going to fabric. These 19 days of detox really have gotten me to appreciate tomorrows event and cherish being back home with the friends I like

Overall, I’m really happy with the way things are going at the moment and I’m writing this just to kind of keep this in text that I’m having a good time. I think the whole experience with Julie made me a lot more confident with being more ballsy with these girls. I’m not so scared of sex with these new girls, or at least I don’t feel like it.
The nicest thing I heard was during the after party at Laura’s where she confessed her love for me, they were talking about me while I was semi passed out and saying how I’m the only person they know when they bring someone new they can guarantee that other person will like and have fun with. I really like that perception of me and I really hope I keep up with that.

Hey
Right now I’m writing this in the living room in cadafais while I kill time until I have to drive biba and Viki to the bus station. The trip is basically over and idk how to feel overall. I’m pissed that I didn’t get anything from it, not even s kiss. I don’t know if she was just very difficult to get and I wasn’t able to get her to become attracted to me. Either ways I’m pissed off. I really thought she had come here with the intentions of wanting to get with me as well. Maybe because biba was here she was a bit scared of doing anything with me in case people would find out, or maybe I just didn’t have enough time to get her to like me. Each progressive day I started to think she was getting more and more into me, yesterday we went to brunch and they got shitfaced while I was rolling with dado and when I saw them they were so happy to see me and so out of their mind drunk. It was cool because me and her were walking together and then we were playing truth or truth in the taxi on the way back. But at the same time I think she might have gotten with another dude. Fuck women holy shit. Like I know that the only person I can blame is myself. I think I’m compensating for my insecurities of intimacy buy paying for their meals and shit like that but that makes me like a peasant in their eyes and I think that deep down that makes it harder for me to get them to get attracted to me. I’m gonna ask for the money for the club tickets back, but everything else I’m gonna leave it as it is because I’m not gonna be petty. I just feel really unfulfilled right now. Like I had a good time I think, but not being able to smash while being with these girls for so long has fucked me up. Like I notice that I feel almost like Ozzy feels when lily is on heat. I don’t eat as much, I feel like I have a sped up heart rate. It’s so fucked and the worst part is that I feel like had I done things slightly different it would have ended differently. Like don’t get me wrong I loved the trip and I could keep going for longer with them, but the lack of sex really messes with me. Maybe if Viki had come alone and it would have just been me and her it would have been different. I think I might have been able to smash. Probably definitely, but it doesn’t change the fact that that’s not the case, and that someway somehow i was not able to get her attracted and comfortable enough to want to even kiss me. I think the root of my feelings right now though are more the fact that I’m a fucking pussy when it comes to acting on my feelings. I didn’t once reveal to Vicki how I felt and that I wanted to get with her. I’ve learned time and time again that the biggest way to get girls to want to smash is to plant the seed in their head that you’re into them. I didn’t do that to Vicki maybe until like the day before yesterday when we were all playing most likely and I had to reveal that out of all the girls I’d want her to piss on me for sexual gratification. Weird but I was so happy in the moment I did that, even though it was slightly awkward. Like I honestly don’t know whether I’m gonna ever tell her how i feel. I’m sure she knows in her mind that I wanted to get with her, it’s the cockiness in women to feel that, but one thing is knowing and another thing would be me straight up proposing it. Even yesterday we were suggesting two different hotel rooms with the guy biba was leading on for free drinks and I don’t know whether the plan would be for me to sleep with Vicki or they slept together and I slept in the other room, because the dude of the hotels I assumed would sleep with biba. But then again I don’t think she would ever want to do that so idk. All I know is that I’m a little disappointed in myself. I keep on thinking that I’m becoming better with getting girls, and I definitely believe I made a lot of improvement but I’m still fundamentally lacking the ability to reveal my feelings. And that really bothers me. I always do this, same with Silvia, same with Linda K the first time, same with Vicki now, I try to make them read my mind that I want them and I think in the process the anger that I get from them not reciprocating makes me bottle up my emotions and then I have to do some salty rant over message to them where I profess my lust for them and hit them with the im not able to talk to you anymore card. I don’t want to do that though, it’s so childish and weak. But I also don’t want to tell it to her face. Idk man, I think I need some serious time to myself to re-evaluate my life right now and what I value in life. I feel so lost and so... I don’t even know what word to say. I feel confused about where my life is going, a little bit out of control. I might be falling into a little bit of a depression right now due to everything — finishing uni and not wanting to work a 9-5, not being satisfied with my relationships with women, wanting to go to a country on the opposite side of the world with the idea of starting basically a new life, but unlike every other move that I’ve done this one would be 100% my responsibility to make it work or not.
I think it’s also the fact that I’ve used these last 10 days as almost like a mental distraction from all my worries and responsibilities. I’m not liking where I’m going in terms of my discipline and my willpower. I think I used to be so much more dedicated and proactive and since uni I’m becoming lazier and lazier. I hate this feeling. I also think that I’m currently being a lot more emotional than I usually am, simply because of the frustration that I have. Just thinking about the girls and how I was sleeping next to them for 10 nights straight and I wasn’t once able to make out with Vicki destroys me. It’s such a pussy thing, such a beta , the type that other people walk over you. I’m being really tough with myself

Hello
It’s been a long and eventful last couple of weeks. I don’t even know where to start. Right now I’m laying in the couch in the living room of the new flat in Camden tired as fuck. Last weekend Silvia and Lucy came to visit me in London. I don’t even know how to explain it. We went to drumsheds and they tried mdma for the first time with me. I was with Silvia most of the time and convinced her to have a casual thing with me and we spent a lot of the time in the club making out while leaving Lucy with Louis dancing. The club was so good, it was hontestly such a good night. They didn’t allow gum inside so Silvia kept chewing the same one she had the whole night and I just asked to have her gum, which i know is a trick that always works. We kept passing the gum back and forth between each other. It was so gross but so hot.
We came back at 9.30 Pm and Bernardo was with Pablo his friend and they had just eaten dinner and we’re gonna leave to Paula’s for pre drinks at 10.30 pm. At this point I had sobered up from the md but Lucy wanted to go out. So we went to Paulinha’s for pre drinks because they were going to Fabric. We get there and it’s nice the girls get along and it’s great. We still don’t have gum so I mention we need gum. The closest shop was 10 minutes away so me and Silvia said we would go there and come back. Bro we left and just started tonguing each other the whole time. It was unreal this girl was so different once she showed her true colours. We got to the shop and bought the gum and a bottle of wine. At this point we had already been clubbing for 7 hours, still feeling the after effects of mdma and had drank like retards just before going to Paula’s. So we were drunk as hell. But we then started just wandering around the area and just making out wherever had a nice corner. It was so fucking nice and both of us were really annoyed that Lucy was here too because we wanted to be alone. Fast forward 1 hour we still haven’t gone back to the Pres and people are texting us to come back and all that shit. I finally sent my live location and they find us in a bar that was already closed where I was talking with some friends of the bartenders and Silvia was slurring arguing with the bartender about how Roma is better than Tottenham. We go home but Silvia wanted to go sleep in her brothers flat. So us 3 go there but Silvia was so gone we didn’t know which floor it was on and it turned out the keys we had were missing the actual door key... anyways We give up and go back to my home and die in our separate beds. Silvia sleeps in brunas room, Lucy went to the couch because Silvia was snoring, and I slept in my room.
The morning after we wake up and we just rot in brunas bed for a while. Then we go to angel again and get the good keys to her brothers room and then go for dinner in soho house with Sofia, one of Lucy’s friends from EHL. This is Sunday. Monday they fly out back to Lausanne and then Wednesday they were flying to Paris, where I’d meet them on Thursday.
Bro at this point I knew it would be fun but I had no idea what would happen. In the 2 days I was in Paris I don’t even know how to describe it. The relationship I had with these girls was like a horny girlfriend that’s also your annoying sister. The gum thing became normalized between the three of us, with us taking gum from each others mouth and so on. The Friday night in Paris we started drinking me and Silvia at 2 pm by the Eiffel Tower. Again, surreal. The vibes truly were amazing. Lucy and I were touching each other quite a lot again, and me and Silvia clearly had a lot of sexual tension too, though it was kind of hidden in front of Licy. Comes to night time and we’re crashing from all the drinking but then we go to dinner and I feel a lot better. We’re at 3 bottles of wine at this point. We’re meant to meet Juli and her friend at 10 to go to a bar. On the walk there we decide to drink even more so we buy another wine bottle and drink it and then another one again and the walk was so fun.
In the bar it was nice and I really liked seeing Juli and her friend Viktoria but the other two girls were too fucked up and they were getting jealous I wasn’t giving them any attention. They were speaking in Spanish saying like “stop flirting with them” and kicking my legs for me to give them the gum from my mouth. Again, so fucking weird and gross but soooo fucking hot. We get 2 drinks and the girls want to dip because they want to go to the club, and they didn’t vibe too much with Julie and viktoria. We head to the club, which is 25 minutes walking. 5 minutes in Julie calls me saying Lucy forgot her HM bag. So I go back and I pick it up, and then I stay with Juli and viktoria for a while just to chat with them alone for a bit. In the meantime Lucy meets some people and they invite her and Silvia to go to their house party upstairs. Lucy goes but Silvia waits outside for me. I arrive and we try to make it inside but they didn’t want to let us in the apartment. Fair enough. Also, fuck French people they’re so annoying and pretentious. Me and Silvia decide to go check if there’s a top floor with a rooftop, which there’s not. And then we start making out in the top floor and then in the elevator back to the bottom. We get there and for some reason the building we were in had a toilet on the bottom floor at the end of the corridor. We go in there and then I’m like come in. And then Silvia’s like “if the door locks then we can do stuff”. Bro the fucking lock did not work I can’t believe how pissed I am thinking back. Changes everything. I know for a fact we would have fucked. For fucks sake I’m so pissed. We make out but nothing else and then fast forward to later Lucy leaves the house party and now we’re once again walking to the club. At this point as Silvia walks ahead I go to Lucy and I’m like let me get your gum and I just start making out with her to get her gum out of her mouth. Then a couple of minutes after we’re like ok now switch gums again and we make out. I swear Silvia knew exactly what was going on but she didn’t mention it and didn’t seem to care at all. Lucy never saw me and Silvia making out but she MUST know, otherwise she’s retarded.
Anyways we’re walking and Pierre calls Silvia, to which Silvia picks up but she’s like ahh I don’t want to talk to him, so she gives it to Lucy for her to talk to him and me and Silvia literally wait for her to walk a bit ahead and start again tonguing each other in an alleyway. She also is horny as shit and she shows me her tits in the middle of the street while walking. Honestly I didn’t look at them for so long to remember the size and shape but I was so turned on.
The club ends up being a dead end so we end up getting an Uber back to my place. This is 3 am at this point. We get home and I get in their air mattress and then Silvia is next to me facing me. We start cuddling. I’m only in underswear and I have my entire leg in between her legs. I convince Lucy to hit the dab pen and then me and Silvia hit it too. Now we’re all high as fuck in the tiny air mattress. We alll talk and laugh and all that shit and then we eventually fall asleep. Me and Silvia cuddle the entire night. I had my hand underneath her shirt a lot of the night too and without any doubt in my mind if Lucy was not in that room I would have smashed Silvia so easily. I’m really annoyed about that. The morning after silvia moves to the other single bed at like 9 am and me and Lucy now sleep together, we don’t cuddle. Then Lucy goes to make us breakfast, and then we eat Lucy showers and then comes lay with me again in the bed. As Silvia is showering and then changing me and Lucy are playing with each other and then I tell her to be my big spoon and she’s like no I’m always small spoon and then eventually I’m spooning her but soooo sexually. She’s wearing a crop top and I have my hand wrapped around her waist and she has her ass on my dick. I am only in underwear and there’s a blanket in between us. Then I start

biting her neck, to which I know she gets horny as fuck. Then I have my hand on her inner thighs but I knew I couldn’t do anything further with Silvia in the house, and I think at that point even in the room.
I still don’t understand how she didn’t care or didn’t mention anything. I was so obviously all over Lucy and she was being so receptive.
Later that day I flew back to London and they both stayed - until tomorrow. Now I’m in a weird post holiday state where I’m not sad or have regrets because I think I did as much as I could. I didn’t ask for a threesome again (I mentioned it to Silvia in the club in London but she said she was too selfish for that - which I believe) but I think I could have. Or I could have found a way to have fucked Silvia by creating a distraction for Lucy or changing the logistics in such a way we would have some time to be alone while she slept. But with the situation I was handed with both of them by their sides 24/7 this is all I was able to do.
Now I’m feeling weird because I want to fuck Silvia, and to a lesser extent Lucy too, but I don’t have a date set for the next time I see them, and I know I won’t be able to smash either of them unless I am alone with them for an extended period of time.
I might suggest a trip to Amsterdam with just Silvia. I wouldn’t mind Lucy going but then I won’t be able to smash and I need to...
I came back from the flight and went straight to meet the Czech people. It was fine it was a normal night, club that failed to get in but I liked seeing Natalie and Mikolaj. Maybe if I would have stayed in Paris I would have had more fun.. idk. I also am worried if I spend too much time with the two girls it’s gonna get boring so I need to only stay with them for short periods of time.
I also now have this feeling since i left and I saw how crazy they are when they are with me that they’re gonna sleep with other dudes. I shouldn’t be jealous about that, although it should have been me, but I think it’s the fact that we don’t message each other once I’m not there anymore that makes me question whether they behaved like that only to me or to other dudes too. I want to think no, because everything points to that but it’s the fact that they do shit always in the hidden that means I will never know, so I assume the worst even though I doubt that would be the case. I shouldn’t care. If I message them about it might come off as needy. Or maybe it would come off as me caring about them - because they might think they are just other girls to me. I think less is more in this situation.
Now the only thing is that I want to spend more time with them, specially I need to smash Silvia before she gets cuffed again. I think that I have set us up for a good dynamic for friends with benefits but I need to have sex with her to secure the deal and also to make me think less about her. I think I’m gonna text her tomorrow or the day after saying that we need to go on a trip just me and her to finish things off. I’m thinking Amsterdam or Spain or some shit like that. Need to figure that out.
There’s other shit going on right now. My graduation was on Wednesday and mom and dad talked to a while and seemed very happy, good for them. I’m thinking about moving out in November instead of December just because it’s too much money for me to be paying out of my pocket.
